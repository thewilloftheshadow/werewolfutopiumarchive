# Things Shadow has questions about:
*all answered below ~ LT*
1. Coins
    - What are they useful for?
2. Roses
    - Need two variables
      - Roses received
      - Roses that can be sent
3. Leaderboards
    - For what?
      - XP?
      - Coins?
      - Wins?
    - This is something that I can work on, since ive done these before
4. Friends
    - Is the bot global?
        - If so, maybe have friend chats to communicate across servers?
          - Could be possible using a website, but maybe a bit complex in the bot itself
        - If not, what purpose would this have?
    - Wouldn't clans be the next logical step?
5. Ranked
    - Will these be rotated out regularly?
6. Avatars
    - I don't really see a way that these would be used, except in `w!profile` or using webhooks in a game channel made just for that game and then deleted (which would be a fun idea)
    
# Thomas's responses:

1. Coins can be used for buying special items, lootboxes, roses and most importantly, custom game maker.
2. Leave roses for later lol
3. Done already :) `w!leaderboard [xp|coins|roses]`
4. to be confirmed
5. Ranked mode will only be released after official release of the bot.  
   Roles will be suggested and voted on by players.
6. idk if we are going to make that
